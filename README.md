To get the api to work:
For the below steps, whatever application you use (Notepad, CMD) make sure to run as administrator
1. add "127.0.0.1 yourdomain.com" to hosts.txt on windows
2. install mkcert and follow the steps in the documentation to generate a self-signed cert for yourdomain.com


Future plans:
implement cookies to persist sessions in case you want to get multiple passwords or do multiple actions
